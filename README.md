Project 2 for CIS-17C

This program is based off the Dungeons & Dragons character system.
It will have create a character class, type, enter a name, and based off the class, it will ask you other things, such as spells for mages, strength, etc.

Afterwards, the program will autimatically run through all the skills and unique actions you can take based off whatever action you decided to take.

After it's done, it will have you repeat the process or exit the program.

This is still a WiP and may be changed in the future.
